# Facial Recognition Time Tracking System

Project Workflow: 

The project's workflow centers around the use of a facial recognition system to manage worker sign-ins and sign-outs while 
recording their details in a secure database. The system operates within specific time constraints, allowing workers to 
check in as they begin their workday and check out as they conclude their tasks. It is designed to perform these operations 
only during predetermined periods, ensuring efficient and accurate time tracking.

Key Components of the Workflow:

Facial Input: Workers utilize the facial recognition feature to sign in and out of their work shifts. The system captures their 
facial data, verifying their identity for secure time tracking.

Database Record: Upon successful facial recognition, the system records the worker's details, including their name, timestamp, and 
other relevant information, in a secure database. This database serves as a comprehensive record of worker attendance.

Time-Bound Operations: The system is to adhere to predetermined time windows for checking in and checking out. This ensures that 
workers can only perform these actions within the specified periods, preventing any unauthorized access.

Efficient Time Tracking: By utilizing facial recognition and the database, the workflow streamlines the time-tracking process, minimizing errors, and enhancing efficiency.

Benefits:

Accurate Time Tracking: The system provides precise records of worker attendance, reducing discrepancies and simplifying payroll management.

Efficiency: Automation through facial recognition enhances the efficiency of the check-in and check-out processes.

Security: Data security measures protect sensitive worker information and attendance records.

Compliance: The system's time-bound operations help ensure compliance with work schedule requirements.

User-Friendly: Workers find the system easy to use, promoting high adoption rates.
